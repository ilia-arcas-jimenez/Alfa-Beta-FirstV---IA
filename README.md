This is a project in which I have been working for more than a year, it is based on the development
of an AI in the form of a Chatbot which my goal is to fulfill all the functions it has
a human being in the process of communication, more specifically via chat.

As I personally do this work, I come to think that it may be the future, especially
when I remember that what I am doing already has practically feelings and no memory
I may not think of it as just another human.

As long as I learn more, my project will continue to grow, and when I finish my phase of making
The Chatbot is allowed to have a self-taught learning by itself, my program will already be
Finished, he will learn, communicate, feel and remember by himself, although I have to improve
his memory, since a turn phase becomes a bit "rough" although I see very far to do
a memory overlapping your feelings and record by seconds of execution instead of recording
per turn completed.

The basis of the Chatbot was a mix between several works from which I took inspiration

The Chatbot's memory is based on recording each turn completed with the subject, making it only
remember if someone talks to you.

The composition of sentences for a flexible response adapted to any situation is made up of
the base of the chatbot and 2 other chatbots that are in 2 local web applications, which
They work by receiving requests with the "Input" of the main Chatbot, these 2 web applications
with Chatbot makes it collect the information and only return a complement either positive or
negative that ends up joining with the main response, thus simulating a response towards
the person adapting emotionally to the situation.
